                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p class="text-muted">by <a href="#" class="author-preview">Padma Bhushan Prof. Gopi chand Narang</a> on March 25, 2014</p>
                <p>
                 The term qawwali is derived from qul, the imperative of the Arabic verb qaula 'to say', 'to speak', In the Holy Quran suras 109, 112 and 114 begin with the word qul 'say!', and this is evidence of the sanctity with which it is regarded. Reading anyone or all of these verses is also part of the fatiha; therefore pronouncing the word qul is the equivalent of a blessing or the conclusion of a prayer. In Arabic qawwal does not mean 'a singer', but rather 'one who speaks volubly' or 'a story teller'. When it was adopted by Urdu its semantic boundaries shifted and the term qawwal was exclusively applied to a person who sang qawwalis. The word qawwal was possibly first used in Turkish in connection with the 'whirling and chanting dervishes' of Jalaluddin Rumi, but when it reached India it gradually became a standard element in the sufistic ritual of the seminaries (khanqahs). In its present form the qawwali is first and foremost an exquisite manifestation of the music and culture born from the interaction of Hinduism and Islam. As a musical form it belongs exclusively to the Indian subcontinent, which began to develop after the advent of Islam during the middle ages. It was patronized and cherished by most Muslim sufis, especially those belonging to the Chishti order.

                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p class="text-muted">by <a href="urdu-ghazal.html" class="author-preview">Padma Bhushan Prof. Gopi chand Narang</a> on March 15, 2014</p>
                <p>
                 Urdu Ghazal is not all about emotions and impressions. It also entails certain ontological and ideological leanings. Though Urdu Ghazal chronicles aesthetic expressions of eternal human fascination with love and beauty which overshadows all other aspects of human life, under the influence of Sufism, it all along displays the metaphoric as well as real aspects of spiritualism. Therefore, weaving philosophy into the warp and woof of poetry it has attempted to disentangle secrets of eternity and existence. These efforts, however, are not aimed at offering any logical solution to the ideological or intellectual enigma. They are mere impressionistic or ecstatic outpourings of poets' inner vision resulting from their discernment of inherited religious beliefs, contemporary culture and social milieu. Therefore, to comprehend the approach of Urdu Ghazal towards the fundamental issues/ problematic of the self and the universe and the creator and the creation, it is imperative to keep in mind the social milieu, the cross currents of Hindu and Muslims thought, and the growth of Sufism which nurtured Urdu Ghazal to its pinnacle.

                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p class="text-muted">by <a href="gopi-chand-narang.html" class="author-preview">Padma Bhushan Prof. Gopi chand Narang</a> on March 15, 2014</p>
                <p>
                 How  not  to  read  Faiz
1
  does  imply  how  Faiz  must  not  be  read,  or  how  Faiz  be
read. But this is not what is intended here. To say how
 Faiz be read or how it should not 
be read sounds prescriptive, and it is not the role of
 criticism to be prescriptive. There are 
readings and readings. Faiz is a popular poet and who
 can tell his admirers how to read 
and how not to read Faiz. It is besides the point that
 there is no dearth of critics who take 
such stance without realizing that their writing is neith
er of any use for literature nor for 
literary criticism. Notwithstanding, the poetry of Faiz 
is read by all sorts of readers, and 
the  graph  of  his  popularity  stays  pretty  stable.  It  is  a
lso  understandable  that  the  camp-
followers  of  a  particular  breed  use  the  poetry  of  Faiz
  to  shield  their  own  shortcomings. 
Popularity  has  its  own  downside,  because  the  crowd  of  adm
irers  comprises  majority  of 
those  who  do  not  know  why  they  like  their  hero.  Do  t
hey  admire  him  because  of  their 
genuine appreciation of his text or simply because other
s admire him? The popularity of 
Faiz, intact even today, was established in the second h
alf of the twentieth century, and 
this is not a short period for the firming of a poetâ€™s 
significance. During this period, much 
has been written about Faiz, but it is a sad fact tha
t many of his admirers admire him for 
wrong  reasons;  they  have  written  little  about  his  poet
ic  worth.  In  this  regard,  Faiz 
deserves our sympathy.
